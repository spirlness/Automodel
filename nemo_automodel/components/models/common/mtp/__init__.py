"""Shared scaffolding for Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) auxiliary heads.

MTP follows the DeepSeek-V3 design (Liu et al., 2024). Each MTP "depth"
predicts one additional future token; per depth the input is rolled left by
one position, fused with the previous-depth hidden state, and passed through
an inner block before producing logits via the shared LM head.

Components in this package are model-agnostic. Model-specific glue (building
the inner block out of the model's own decoder layers, wiring HF state-dict
keys) lives in the model's own package.
